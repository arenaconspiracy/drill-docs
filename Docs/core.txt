=========================================
Drill Station (working title) core design
=========================================
as envisioned by arenaconspiracy
subject to override


The concept for Drill Station came from a wish for non antag-driven roundflow,
The core idea is that roundflow is dictated by an autonomous Drill at the center of the station,
with periods of "uptime" and "downtime" corresponding to the Drill being on and off.

Players are challenged by action and events during "uptime" with increasing difficulty scaling
as the round progresses, and given breathing room and time to roleplay during "downtime".

Gameplay takes place underground, on a mining station embedded in solid rock.
The station is surrounded by procedurally generated caverns serving as space for hostile
mobs to spawn out of view of players, and assault the station.
Rounds are a survival challenge, the crew of the station should be subject to permadeath,
with rounds having an end-condition of no humanoid crew left standing.
The primary goal of a round, another end-condition, is achieving a set profit quota for the station,
achieved through selling the output of the Drill the station is built around.
There should be a primary "target product" the drill produces, such as Phoron, that has a sell value
far surpassing anything else, with occasional use on station. Other output from the drill should
be sellable, but have primary use in sustaining the station.
Once the shift profit quota has been reached, command may authorize an evacuation pod to drop
down to the station's level, and subsequently take off, ending the round.

While the Drill is in operation, it causes events that pose hazards to the station crew,
such as structural faults in the Drill itself, structural faults in the station, and attracting
the attention of HTN and ghostrole mobs that antagonize the crew.
The drill must be supplied with HV power mandatory to drive operations, and ventilation gas to
manage it's hazard. If supplied with insufficient power, the drill shuts down. If supplied with
insufficient ventilation, the drill starts venting hazardous gas into the room it's in.


*******************************
Drill mechanical specifications
*******************************

The Drill must alternate between phases of activity and inactivity.
It has a minimum cooldown of 15 minutes between phase change, and automatically switches phase
after 30 minutes. Between the 15 to 30 minute interval Command can choose to start/stop it early.

Instead of a scheduler gamerule (BasicStationEventScheduler/RampingEventScheduler),
mid-round events are triggered by the Drill during the active phase.

The Drill is built similarly to an upstream AME, with a Drill Body functionally identical to
AME shielding. The Drill's functionality resides in Components and Ports adjacent to the body.
The Computer Control Component has crew interfaces including a large screen, it provides status
information and serves as the control panel for early start/stop for Command.
Input ports must be placed on corner tiles of the Drill body -
Output ports must be placed on edge tiles of the drill body, with a core tile behind it.
The exceptions are the Computer Control Component, and a unique Universal Power Input,
which are meant to be pre-mapped.
The Drill body, Computer Component, and a set of pre-mapped ports are immutable and indestructible.
Map flavor and challenge (in regards to engineering gameplay) is expressed through the preset
configuradion of the Drill, and it's distance to the destination of it's products.
There are 3 tiers of most Ports. A higher tier means a higher the throughput and resource consumption.
Input ports are comprised of Power and Gas inputs -
Output ports are comprised of Phoron, Gas, Reagent, Ore, and Miscellaneous outputs.

All ports have a power cost & ventilation demand, except inputs which don't cost their input.

The drill can be upgraded by Engineers during the round, with an increased challenge in demands
and risk of failure, and a high material cost for new ports, in exchange for an increase in
outputs for resources and profits.
