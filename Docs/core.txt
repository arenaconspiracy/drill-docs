=========================================
Drill Station (working title) core design
=========================================
as envisioned by arenaconspiracy
subject to override


The concept for Drill Station came from a wish for non antag-driven roundflow,
The core idea is that roundflow is dictated by an autonomous Drill at the center of the station,
with periods of "uptime" and "downtime" corresponding to the Drill being on and off.

Players are challenged by action and events during "uptime" with increasing difficulty scaling
as the round progresses, and given breathing room and time to roleplay during "downtime".
The intent is to have a cycle between an actively hazardous period, a 'station repairs' period,
and a 'relaxation' period for the crew - cycling between action focus and roleplay focus. 

Gameplay takes place underground, on a mining station embedded in solid rock.
The map is a large arena of destructible rock, with an outer layer of indestructible walls,
with the station embedded in the center, surrounded by procedurally generated caverns
serving as an out of view spawn area for hostile mobs.

Instead of a continuous event scheduler gamerule, events are called by the Drill while in operation.
The intensity and difficulty of hazardous threats ramps up during the round. With a survival
aspect looming over the crew. Subject to permadeath, the elimination of all crew serving as one
possible round end condition.

The overarching goal of a round is achieving a set profit quota, reaching a population dependent
balance in the station budget, achieved through selling the output of the Drill.

There is a "target product" the Drill produces (diegetically the reason the station is built)
in the form of Phoron, that has a sell value far surpassing anything else the Drill produces,
with occasional use on station. Other output from the Drill can be sold for less profit,
but is primarily used in sustaining the station.
Once the shift profit quota has been reached, Command may authorize an evacuation pod to drop
down to the station's level, and subsequently take off, ending the round.

The gameplay depth comes from managing, modifying, and living around the Drill. It produces
vital resources necessary to sustain the station - but the crew must deal with it's inherent
danger, and adapt to mid-round changes to it's setup and supply routes from the Drill to their
destinations which have fixed locations.

The station is a closed resource loop, with the exception of requisitions and sales.
Resources and waste products must be managed and recycled onstation, with minimal disposal methods.

Hazards to the crew include structural faults in the Drill itself, structural faults in the station,
hostile HTN and ghostrole mobs attracted by the Drill, and failures in other station infrastructure
such as power engines or other vital machinery.

The core gameplay loop does not rely on the presence of antagonists. The base gamemode is Survival,
where the whole crew works together to achieve the goal of Surviving and reaching the profit quota.
Additional gamemodes can introduce antagonists to modify the core gameplay experience,
but it comes as an optional, auxiliary component to the gameplay.


*******************************
Drill mechanical specifications
*******************************

The Drill constantly alternates between phases of activity and inactivity.
It has a minimum cooldown of 15 minutes between phase change, and automatically switches phase
after 30 minutes. Between the 15 to 30 minute interval Command can choose to start/stop it early.

While the Drill is active, it calls event gamerules that threaten the station and it's structure,
mid-round events are triggered by the Drill during the active phase.
The intensity and volume of some gamerules scales up as the round progresses; incentivising
resource management by the crew, and upgrading the Drill to reach the profit quota sooner.

The Drill functionally can be compared to an AME from upstream, consisting of 2 (kinds of) parts.
A Drill body, similar to AME shielding - and attached modules & ports, similar to AME controllers.
The Drill has many different Input and Output ports, as well as a discrete Computer Control Module.
Input ports must be adjacent to body corner tiles, and output ports must be adjacent to edge tiles
with a core tile behind it. With the exception of the computer module & a roundstart power input,
which work adjacent to any tile.

The map starts with a pre-mapped Drill assembly with a configuration immutable during the round.
Engineers can add additional parts onto the Drill assembly to increase it's productivity midround.
The body, computer, basic power input, and premade outputs are indestructible and cannot be moved
or modified, the "flavor" and unique challenge in a map comes from it's configuration of the Drill
and destination infrastructure, and possible ways to bulldoze the station to make supply routes.

The Computer Control Module serves as a console through which crew can interface with the Drill,
see it's parameters/data readouts, and engage the manual start/stop.

Input ports include Power and Gas input required for power supply and ventilation. Every connected
port has a resource demand, except input ports which do not demand what they're supplying.
Input ports are limited by a 'choke' on the wattage & gas volume they can supply to the Drill.

Output ports include Phoron, Ore, Gas, Reagent, and Miscellaneous outputs.
Phoron ports output Phoron into discrete Phoron Barrels connected to them.
Ore ports output chunks of ore onto conveyor belts.
Gas ports output spent ventilation/exhaust gasses, and mined gases, configurable to send specific
gas to specific pipe layers attached.
Reagent ports output reagents to an internal buffer, which can be transfered to storage tanks.
Miscellaneous ports spit out odds and ends into disposal pipes.

Most port types have 3 tiers, a higher tier corresponding to a higher throughput & resource demand.
Pre-mapped, indestructible ports are discrete, but correspond to Tier 2 of their type.

New ports come at a high material cost, increased challenge with their demands, and must be
researched before thier machine boards can be printed. Drill ports use a discrete, directional
machine frame separate from the generic machine frame for everything else.

The Drill, and destinations for it's outputs such as the Requisition/Sale pad, power engines, et alii
are practically or literally immobile, to create depth and challenge in midround modifications to
supply routes from the Drill and back.
