==========================================
Drill Station (working title) core concept
==========================================
Written arenaconspiracy


The concept for Drill Station came from a wish for a round flow not reliant on antagonists driving it.
It's core idea is that roundflow is dictated by an autonomous Drill at the center of the station,
with periods of "uptime" and "downtime" corresponding to the Drill being on and off.
The Drill autonomously turns on and off on a set timer of 30 minutes. The 1st and 2nd in command
on the station have the authority to manually start/stop the Drill after 15 minutes of either state.

During uptime, the Drill's operation causes events that place the station and it's crew in danger.
The volume and intensity of the threats scales as the round goes on, until it ends.
During downtime, the crew is given time to breathe, repair damage to the station and themselves,
and relax & engage in unobstructed roleplay.
The round permanently cycles between uptime and downtime on a set, predictable period, with Command
being able to influence it only in emergencies. 

Gameplay takes place underground, on a mining station embedded in solid rock.
The map is a large grid of rock with an indestructible outer rim, and a network of procedurally
generated caverns, centering on the station. The caverns are barren and serve only as out-of-view
spawn points for hostile mobs. The crew has no reason to leave the station for the caverns.

Instead of a continuous event scheduler gamerule, events are called by the Drill while in operation.
The entire crew is involved in the hazards to the station, which comes from the Drill, failing station
infrastructure, and hostile mobs brought by the Drill.
Antagonists among the crew are an optional modification to the gameplay, as an auxiliary to the game.
The crew is subject to permadeath, elimination of all crew members serves as a round end condition.

The overarching goal of a round is achieving a set profit quota, reaching a population dependent
balance in the station budget, achieved through selling the output of the Drill.
There is a "target product" the Drill produces in the form of Phoron,
that has a sell value far surpassing anything else the Drill produces, with occasional use on station.
The other outputs of the Drill can be sold at a lesser price, but are more necessary on the station.

Once the shift profit quota has been reached, Command may authorize an evacuation pod to drop
down to the station's level, and subsequently take off, ending the round.

The gameplay depth comes from managing, modifying, and living around the Drill. It produces
vital resources necessary to sustain the station, but the crew must deal with it's inherent danger,
and adapt to it's whims, and changes made to the station for the sake of upgrades and supply routes
between the Drill and destinations with fixed locations, such as the Requisitions Pad, power engines,
et cetera.


*******************************
Drill mechanical specifications
*******************************

The Drill permanently cycles between uptime and downtime with a maximum interval of 30 minutes
between phase changes. After 15 minutes of either state the SO or DO can run an emergency start/stop.
Dedicated gamemodes may modify the intervals, creating more extreme experiences.

The Drill structurally can be compared to an AME from upstream, consisting of 2 (kinds of) parts.
A Drill body, similar to AME shielding - and attached modules & ports, similar to AME controllers.
The Drill has many different Input and Output ports, as well as a discrete Computer Control Module.
Input ports must be adjacent to body corner tiles, and output ports must be adjacent to edge tiles
with a core tile behind it. With the exception of the computer module & a roundstart power input,
which both work adjacent to any tile.

The map starts with a pre-mapped Drill assembly with a configuration immutable during the round.
Engineers can add additional parts onto the Drill assembly to increase it's productivity midround.
The body, computer, roundstart inputs and outputs are indestructible and cannot be moved or modified,
the "flavor" and unique challenge in a map comes from it's configuration of the Drill and
it's relations to destination structures, and possible ways to modify the station for supply routes.

The Computer Control Module serves as a console through which crew can interface with the Drill,
see it's parameters/data readouts, and engage the manual start/stop.

Input ports include Power and Gas input required for power supply and ventilation. Every connected
port has a resource demand, except input ports which do not demand what they're supplying.
Input ports are limited by a 'choke' on the wattage & gas volume they can supply to the Drill.

Output ports include Phoron, Ore, Gas, Reagent, and Miscellaneous outputs.
Phoron ports output Phoron into discrete Phoron Kegs connected to them.
Ore ports output chunks of ore onto conveyor belts.
Gas ports output mined gas, configurable to send specific gasses to separate attached pipe layers.
Reagent ports output reagents to an internal buffer, which can be transfered to storage tanks.
Miscellaneous ports spit out odds and ends into disposal pipes.

Most port types have 3 tiers, a higher tier corresponding to a higher throughput & resource demand.
Pre-mapped, indestructible ports are discrete, but correspond to Tier 2 of their type.

New ports come at a high material cost, increased challenge with their demands, and must be
researched before thier machine boards can be printed. Drill ports use a discrete, directional
machine frame separate from the generic machine frame for everything else.

The Drill, and destinations for it's outputs such as the Requisition/Sale pad, power engines, et alii
are practically or literally immobile, to create depth and challenge in midround modifications to
supply routes from the Drill and back.
