Drill Station department design
===============================
Written by arenaconspiracy


Each station department is tasked with unique, largely non-overlapping duties.
Every crew member has a functionally identical backpack item, and each role has a standard issue
gearing consisting of a belt slot item and 2 pocket slot pouches necessary to perform their job,
intended to be worn 100% of the time. Crew members are limited to their role by the amount of 
job-related gear they can carry on their person, with personal storage being at a premium.

All role specific gear, including functional clothing should start in the respective job's locker,
and crew members should spawn with a minimum of cosmetic clothing and a backpack.

Death is permanent. Losing a crew member should mean a tangible increase in tension on station work.


*********************
Operations Department
*********************
The Operations department is responsible for working with & around the Drill and it's products.
It closely resembles a joint of SS14 Engineering and Cargo in it's function.

Operations is comprised of Maintenance Technicians [MTs] (analogue to station engineers),
Supply Technicians [STs] (analogue to cargo technicians), and Director of Operations [DO] as the
department head.
MTs are responsible for maintaining & upgrading the Drill, handling it's waste products,
fixing & modifying the station, and maintaining the station power.
STs are responsible for handling the Drill's desired products, handling requisitions & sales,
and ensuring the departments are supplied during the round.
The DO is responsible for leading Operations, coordinating the staiton's needs with other Command,
and being one of the two people authorized to early start/stop the Drill (outside of skeleton crews).
Operations is expected to modify the station to the whims of the Drill in the name of profits,
the DO generally being considered second in command on the station.

MTs should be expected to attend to the Drill during uptime, and to the power engines during downtime,
as well as repair damage to the station during both uptime & downtime.
The station should experience semi-frequent structural faults during the round to encourage MTs to
attend to them in various locations, bringing them away from the static drill and power engine.
MTs will be expected to bulldoze structures and departments near the Drill for upgrades, and to
pave new supply lines between it and sales pads, atmospherics, power engines, and other immobile 
destinations across the station.

STs should be expected to deliver supplies between departments, make sales of Phoron and other surplus
at the Requisitions Pad in Ops, handle & purchase requisitions using the station budget.
STs should be required to approach the Drill to do their job, to process it's outputs, and subject
themselves to the hazards that come from the Drill's operation.

The DO should be expected to command MTs on modifications to make, evaluate when requisitions are
worth cutting into the station budget, and coordinate resource use between departments. The DO is
expected to be second in command to the Site Overseer in an emergency.

The station's power supply should be provided by relatively simple power engines, to shift depth
from the engines to the Drill.
Continous operation of power engines should produce waste products and environmental hazards in
their immediate area, with guaranteed failure states if left unmaintained for too long.
Power engines should be immobile practically (extensive waste management infrastructure which
takes up space) or immobile totally (cannot be deconstructed or unanchored)

Sales and requisitions happen on an immobile Requisitions Pad, sales are winched up and requisitions
are dropped down in crates. Purchased crates have the potential to crush things they land on.
Purchases using the unified station budget cut into the profit quota, thereby delaying the round
end condition. It should be a challenge to evaluate what purchases are worth cutting into profits.


******************
Medical Department
******************
The Medical department is responsible for keeping the station's crew in good health.
Crew deaths are permanent. Resources are at a premium. Time until next cycle is finite.

(this document assumes Offmed or a similar medical system is implemented)

Medical is comprised of Nurses, Doctors, Paramedics, Chemists, and the Chief Medical Officer [CMO].
Nurses are responsible for stabilizing patients on site and treating minor damage.
Doctors are responsible for performing surgery and treating major damage.
Paramedics are responsible for moving & retrieving injured crew members from around the station,
and stabilizing patients outside of the medical bay.
Chemists are responsible for stocking the medbay with medical reagents.
The CMO is responsible for leading Medical, ensuring patients are handled correctly and efficiently,
and assisting treatment.

The individual medical roles should be mechanically encouraged to separate their duties.
A sufficiently advanced medical system creates a divide between stabliziation/healing/aftercare
on it's own, but additional means should be employed, such as Doctors getting belts with surgical
tools; Nurses getting belts holding reagent bottles, syringes, injectors, et alii;
Paramedics being able to store rollerbeds in a specialized belt, which are otherwise too big to store;
the Chemist workflow being sufficiently involved; et cetera.

The supplies in the Chemistry lab should be limited. The round should start with enough to
stock the bay with a minimal supply of basics that last the Medbay the first uptime at most.
Chemists should be expected to process the output of the Drill to source more precursors for medicine.


*******************
Security Department
*******************
The Security department is responsible for neutralizing threats from the caverns assaulting the
station, and arresting crew members breaking the law.

Security consists of Security Officers, the Warden, and the Head of Security [HoS].
Security Officers are responsible for the defense of the station against hostile mobs & arresting
crew members breaking the law.
The Warden is expected to oversee inmates & manage materials used to print ammo and supplies.
The Head of Security commands the department.

As threats to the station are nearly everpresent, locking away arms in an armory is less important.
Instead, focus is placed on personal-carry weapons, with frequent ammo restocks at security necessary
to sustain fire.

Due to the scarcity and cost of medical treatment, security is encouraged to use nonlethal tools
above all else when performing arrests, and are highly liable for crossfire or unnecessary damage.

Security members are all given a standard issue set of a combat knife, a sidearm with a holster,
and a small pouch for sidearm magazines. As well as a choice of a major weapon surpassing the
sidearm and weapons available to anyone else. Starting available options should include 1 option
for each brute damage type, e.g. a machete (slash), a sledgehammer (blunt), and a shotgun (piercing).
Other weapons could be unlockable through research, acting as upgrades and filling new niches.

Hostile mobs should have a high diversity, with certain enemies having notable mild, major,
resistances, and vulnerabilities to damage types, encouraging security officers to diversify their
choice of weapon across the security force and between rounds.

Personal carry should let you keep barely enough ammunition to last a particularly intense uptime,
encouraging constant restocks & the viability of melee options. Ammo boxes should have a notable
do-after filling magazines, and only let you replenish one magazine at a time, to complicate using
them for carrying ammunition on your person.


*******************
Research Department
*******************

******************
Service Department
******************
The Service deparment is responsible for maintaining the station's morale and padding out downtime.

Service consists of Chefs, Bartenders, Janitors, the Clown, and the Service Manager [SM].
Chefs are responsible for growing crops, turning hostile mobs into food, and preparing meals.
Bartenders are responsible for tending the bar, and preparing drinks.
Janitors are responsible for cleaning the station, and maintaining decoration.
The Clown does clown things.
The Service Manager commands the department, makes sure the crew is fed and enriched,
and yells at the Clown.

Service should be expected to be more active during downtime, facilitating relaxed roleplay
engagements and contrasting the gameplay intensity of uptime.
Service roles should have substantial enough mechanics and impactful enough duties to necessitate
belts & pouches carried at all times. Service roles should not be able to 'fill in gaps' in staffing
by using gear from other departments that they have the space for, nor should they be 'spare hands'
that can be hired to a department if necessary.

The SM has access to a uniform printer, capable of printing alternative or replacement clothing for
crew members, not limited to clothing from the service department.


******************
Command Department
******************
The head of all other departments collectively form the Command department, additionally headed by
the Site Overseer (SO) holding authority over the station, in a Captain role.

Command members should be expected to consistently communicate and closely negotiate resource use
accross the departments. The SO should be expected to ensure departments are adequately performing and
working in tandem through oversight, doing work manually only in case of emergency.

The SO and DO have the authority to manually start/stop the Drill after 15 minutes in either state,
colluding with the entire crew to determine when starting/stopping is in the crew's best interests.

The SO should be able to defend themselves individually, but not assist in defense on the frontline.
Potentially achieved with a high burst, low sustain weapon, with hard to carry ammo, like a revolver.
