===============================
Drill Station department design
===============================
As envisioned by arenaconspiracy


Each department on the station is responsible for sustaining the station and/or it's crew.
The roles of every department are highly distinct and largely non-overlapping.
Crew members are limited to their own role by the amount of job-related items they can carry
on their person.



*************************************
Operations Department (working title)
*************************************
The Operations department is responsible for working with & around the Drill and it's products.
It closely resembles a mixture of SS14 Engineering and Cargo in it's function.

Operations is comprised of Maintenance Technicians [MTs] (analogue to station engineers),
Supply Technicians [STs] (analogue to cargo technicians), and Director of Operations [DO] as the
department head.
MTs are responsible for maintaining & upgrading the Drill, handling it's waste products,
fixing & modifying the station, and maintaining the station power.
STs are responsible for handling the Drill's desired products, handling requisitions & sales,
and ensuring the departments are supplied during the round.
The DO is responsible for leading Operations, coordinating the staiton's needs with other Command,
and being one of the two people authorized to early start/stop the drill (outside of skeleton crews).
Operations is expected to modify the station to the whims of the Drill in the name of profits,
the DO generally being considered second in command on the station.

MTs should be expected to attend to the Drill during uptime, and to the power engines during downtime.
The station should experience semi-frequent structural faults during the round to encourage MTs to
attend to them in miscellaneous locations, bringing them away from their other responsibilities.
MTs will be expected to bulldoze structures and departments near the Drill for upgrades, and to
pave new supply lines between it and sales pads, atmospherics, and other immovable installations.

STs should be expected to deliver supplies between departments, make sales of Phoron and other surplus
at the Sales Pad in their area, purchase requisitions using the station budget and deliver them.
STs should be required to approach the Drill to do their job, to process it's outputs, and subject
themselves to the hazards that come from the drill's operation.

The DO should be expected to command MTs on modifications to make, evaluate when requisitions are
worth cutting into the station budget, and coordinate resource use between departments. The DO is
expected to be second in command to the Captain* of the station in an emergency. The DO should not
be expected to carry the tools or perform the duties of MTs under normal circumstances, but should
be free to do so in emergencies.

*Captain analogue from SS14. Name undecided as of yet.


The station's power supply should be provided by relatively simple power engines, to shift depth
from the engines to the Drill.
Power engines should follow a basic schema of Fuel In -> Power & Waste out.
Continous operation of power engines should produce waste products and environmental hazards in
their immediate area, with guaranteed failure states if left unmaintained for too long.
Power engines should be immobile practically (extensive waste management infrastructure which
takes up space) or immobile totally (cannot be deconstructed or unanchored)
